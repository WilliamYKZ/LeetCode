# 136. Single Number

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. 

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space. 



```python
Input : nums = [4,1,2,2,1]
Output: 4
```



It will be really easy to using XOR. since if $a,b$ are same then $a \oplus b=a\ XOR\ b=0 $. If $a,b$ are not the same then $a\oplus b=1$. 



So if element appears twice the XOR will let all those number oplus as $0$, and it will not influence the outcome. Only element appears single will save in temp.



```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int temp = 0;
        int length = nums.length;
        for(int i = 0; i < length; i++){
            temp = temp ^ nums[i];
        }
        
        return temp;
    }
}
```
